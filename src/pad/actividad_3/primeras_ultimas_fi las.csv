0,0,Italy,"Aromas include tropical fruit, broom, brimstone and dried herb. The palate isn't overly expressive, offering unripened apple, citrus and dried sage alongside brisk acidity.",Vulkà Bianco,87,,Sicily & Sardinia,Etna,,Kerin O’Keefe,@kerinokeefe,Nicosia 2013 Vulkà Bianco  (Etna),White Blend,Nicosia
1,1,Portugal,"This is ripe and fruity, a wine that is smooth while still structured. Firm tannins are filled out with juicy red berry fruits and freshened with acidity. It's  already drinkable, although it will certainly be better from 2016.",Avidagos,87,15.0,Douro,,,Roger Voss,@vossroger,Quinta dos Avidagos 2011 Avidagos Red (Douro),Portuguese Red,Quinta dos Avidagos
2,2,US,"Tart and snappy, the flavors of lime flesh and rind dominate. Some green pineapple pokes through, with crisp acidity underscoring the flavors. The wine was all stainless-steel fermented.",,87,14.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Willamette Valley,Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine ,Rainstorm 2013 Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley),Pinot Gris,Rainstorm
3,3,US,"Pineapple rind, lemon pith and orange blossom start off the aromas. The palate is a bit more opulent, with notes of honey-drizzled guava and mango giving way to a slightly astringent, semidry finish.",Reserve Late Harvest,87,13.0,Michigan,Lake Michigan Shore,,Alexander Peartree,,St. Julian 2013 Reserve Late Harvest Riesling (Lake Michigan Shore),Riesling,St. Julian
4,4,US,"Much like the regular bottling from 2012, this comes across as rather rough and tannic, with rustic, earthy, herbal characteristics. Nonetheless, if you think of it as a pleasantly unfussy country wine, it's a good companion to a hearty winter stew.",Vintner's Reserve Wild Child Block,87,65.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Willamette Valley,Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine ,Sweet Cheeks 2012 Vintner's Reserve Wild Child Block Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),Pinot Noir,Sweet Cheeks
129966,129966,Germany,"Notes of honeysuckle and cantaloupe sweeten this deliciously feather-light spätlese. It's intensely juicy, quenching the palate with streams of tart tangerine and grapefruit acidity, yet wraps up with a kiss of honey and peach.",Brauneberger Juffer-Sonnenuhr Spätlese,90,28.0,Mosel,,,Anna Lee C.

129967,129967,US,"Citation is given as much as a decade of bottle age prior to release, which means it is pre-cellared and drinking at its peak.

129968,129968,France,"Well-drained gravel soil gives this wine its crisp and dry character. It is ripe and fruity, although the spice is subdued in favor of a more serious structure.

129969,129969,France,"A dry style of Pinot Gris, this is crisp with some acidity. It also has weight and a solid, powerful core of spice and baked apple flavors. With its structure still developing, the wine needs to age. Drink from 2015.",,90,32.0,Alsace,Alsace,,Roger Voss,@vossroger,Domaine Marcel Deiss 2012 Pinot Gris (Alsace),Pinot Gris,Domaine Marcel Deiss
129970,129970,France,"Big, rich and off-dry, this is powered by intense spiciness and rounded texture. Lychees dominate the fruit profile, giving an opulent feel to the aftertaste.
